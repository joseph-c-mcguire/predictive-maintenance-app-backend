# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance system for industrial equipment using machine learning techniques to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.

## Steps to Complete the Project
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Development
6. Model Evaluation and Selection
7. Model Interpretation
8. Deployment
9. Monitoring and Maintenance
10. Documentation and Presentation

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance-scikit-learn-example.git
   cd predictive-maintenance-scikit-learn-example
   ```
2. Install Poetry (if not already installed).
    ```sh
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```
3. Install the required packages using Poetry.
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```
## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run each script in order:
   - `data_collection.py`
